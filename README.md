#  Satellite Imagery Based Property Valuation (Multimodal Regression)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting residential property prices using a **multimodal regression approach** that combines traditional tabular housing data with satellite imagery. In addition to structural property attributes, visual environmental context such as surrounding infrastructure, green cover, and waterfront proximity is incorporated to improve valuation accuracy.

The project uses latitude and longitude coordinates to programmatically fetch satellite images for each property and extracts visual features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These image-based features are fused with engineered tabular features to train a multimodal regression model for property price prediction.

All experiments and data processing were implemented using **Google Colab**, with datasets and intermediate files stored and accessed via **Google Drive** for persistence and reproducibility.

##  Google Drive Directory Structure

All project data and outputs are organized within a single Google Drive folder. Once Google Drive is mounted in Google Colab, the notebooks automatically read from and write to this structure.

### Directory Description
- **data/raw/** – Original input datasets and raw metadata files  
- **data/raw/images/train/** – Satellite images corresponding to training properties  
- **data/raw/images/test/** – Satellite images corresponding to test properties  
- **data/processed/** – All processed tabular data, CNN-extracted image features, and train/validation splits  
- **predictions/** – Final price predictions generated using the trained multimodal model  
- **data_fetcher.py** – Script for downloading satellite images using latitude and longitude  
- **models/** - Saved final model used for prediction

All processed files and outputs are generated automatically once the input datasets are placed in the `data/raw/` directory.

##  Satellite Image Download (data_fetcher.py)

Satellite images for each property are programmatically downloaded using the **Mapbox Static Images API** based on latitude and longitude coordinates provided in the dataset.

The script `data_fetcher.py`:
- Reads geographic coordinates from the tabular data
- Calls the Mapbox Static Images API to fetch satellite images for each property
- Saves the downloaded images into structured Google Drive directories:
  - `data/raw/images/train/` for training properties
  - `data/raw/images/test/` for test properties

These satellite images capture surrounding environmental context such as road networks, vegetation, water bodies, and urban density, which are later used for CNN-based feature extraction in the multimodal pipeline.

> **Note:** A valid Mapbox access token is required to use the API. The token should be provided by the user and configured within the script or environment variables.
